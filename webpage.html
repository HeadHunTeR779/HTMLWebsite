      Earth is the third planet from the Sun and is the largest of the terrestrial planets. Unlike the other planets in the
      solar system that are named after classic deities the Earth&#39;s name comes from the Anglo-Saxon
      word erda which means ground or soil. The Earth was formed approximately 4.54 billion years ago and
      is the only known planet to support life.
